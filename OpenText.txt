Christmas Day is one of the most favorite American holidays It is celebrated on December.
Christmas is a Christian holiday marking the birth of the Christ Child.
Decorating houses and yards with lights, putting up Christmas trees, giving gifts, and sending greeting cards
have become traditions even for many non Christian Americans here also a tradition to place a decorated Christmas
tree in the White House, the official home in Washington D.C. of the President of the USA.
The tradition of placing a decorated tree in the White House began in on Christmas morning during the
Presidency of Benjamin Harrison. The Presidents grandchildren young Benjamin and Mary McKee, led the Harrison
household into the second floor Oval Room to take a look at the first White House Christmas tree. It was lit
with candles. Filled stockings hung from the mantel. Presents, candy and nuts were distributed to family and
staff. President Harrison gave turkeys and gloves to his employees. He received a silver dollars haped picture
holder from his daughter, Mame Harrison McKee.
What began as a family gathering has become a national tradition. Over the years, the White House Christmas tree 
has reflected both the times and the tastes of the First Family. First Lady Frances Cleveland created a technology
savvy tree in when she hung electric lights on the White House tree. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy began the
tradition of Christmas Tree themes when she decorated the Christmas tree in toy trimmings from the Nutcracker
Suite ballet by Tchaikovsky.
Today, the First Lady selects a theme and taps the talents of American artisans, who give life to the idea. Laura
Bush chose Home for the Holidays for the theme, which features replicas of the family homes of the nations
Presidents. The Presidents Christmas tree can be viewed by anyone either in the news programs, or on the official 
web site of the White House.
